# Questioning Guide for GSD

Effective questioning extracts everything needed for successful implementation.

## Core Principle

**Better to ask 10 questions now than fix 10 misunderstandings later.**

## Question Categories

### 1. Problem Understanding
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What are they doing today without this?
- Why is the current solution inadequate?

### 2. Scope Definition
- What MUST be included (non-negotiable)?
- What SHOULD be included (important)?
- What COULD be included (nice-to-have)?
- What is OUT of scope?

### 3. Success Criteria
- How will we know this is successful?
- What metrics matter?
- What does "done" look like?

### 4. Constraints
- What are the technical constraints?
- What are the business constraints?
- What are the time constraints?
- Are there regulatory/compliance requirements?

### 5. Context
- What similar projects exist?
- What lessons learned should we apply?
- Are there existing patterns to follow?

## Questioning Patterns

### The 5 Whys
Keep asking "why" until you reach the root need.

### Concrete Examples
Ask for specific examples instead of abstractions.
- ❌ "How should it work?"
- ✅ "Walk me through a user signing up"

### Edge Cases
- What should happen when...?
- How should errors be handled?
- What if the user does X instead of Y?

## Documentation

Capture answers in:
- REQUIREMENTS.md (what)
- PROJECT.md (why)
- PLAN.md (how)
