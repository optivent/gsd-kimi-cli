# Project: KIMI-GSD-EX (Elixir Fork)

## Vision
Build the ultimate AI-powered development environment: a fault-tolerant, distributed, real-time collaborative CLI that seamlessly integrates spec-driven development workflows with intelligent agent orchestration.

## Mission
Create a complete Elixir rewrite of kimi-cli with native GSD integration, enabling:
- 10x faster parallel agent execution
- Zero-downtime reliability through OTP supervision
- Real-time team collaboration
- Stateful sessions across devices
- Cloud-native distributed architecture

## Elevator Pitch
"What if your CLI was as reliable as WhatsApp, as fast as a compiled language, and enabled team collaboration like Google Docs?"

## Target Users
- Professional development teams (5-50 engineers)
- AI-assisted development power users
- Organizations adopting spec-driven development
- Developers frustrated with flaky AI tools

## Success Metrics
- 1000+ concurrent agent processes
- <50ms response time for all operations
- 99.99% uptime (self-healing)
- Zero data loss on crashes
- <1 week learning curve for new users

## Differentiation
- Only AI CLI built on battle-tested telecom-grade infrastructure (Erlang/OTP)
- Native real-time collaboration (not bolted-on)
- Stateful sessions survive crashes/disconnects
- Distributed by design (not single-machine limitation)
